#RollerDog

At Zappos we have a project known as Wishez where people can wish for something and be paired with someone who can fulfil that wish. Recently someone asked for a dog wheelchair, and I thought that creating an easily makeable one that is open source and well documented would be much more useful than buying a one-off. This is that project. Let's see how it goes.
