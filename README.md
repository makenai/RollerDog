#RollerDog

At Zappos we have a project known as Wishez where people can wish for something and be paired with someone who can fulfil that wish. Recently someone asked for a dog wheelchair, and I thought that creating an easily makeable one that is open source and well documented would be much more useful than buying a one-off. This is that project. Let's see how it goes.

Currently needed:

- Wheels of some sort
- Roller blade bearings (608 size)
- 1/2" PVC pipe
- PVC elbows
- 3D printer (or a friend with one)

Stuff provided:

wheel_adapter.scad - Clamps on to PVC pipe and takes two bearings and a wheel can bolt on. Can be used in either vertical or horizontal orientation.

t_joint.scad - Clamps a PVC pipe perpendicular to another PVC pipe. This is similar to a T intersection made of PVC but doesn't require two cut sections so it can be adjusted easily.
